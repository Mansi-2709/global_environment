## About the dataset used
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of key environmental indicators collected over a span of 24 years (2000â€“2024) across multiple countries. It is designed to support analyses that explore the interplay between climate variables, human activities, and environmental changes. The dataset is particularly useful for researchers, data scientists, and policy analysts interested in climate change, sustainability, and environmental impact studies.

Key Features:

Year: Indicates the calendar year of each record.

Country: The country from which the data was recorded.

Avg_Temperature_degC: Average annual temperature in degrees Celsius, offering insights into regional and global warming trends.

CO2_Emissions_tons_per_capita: Annual per capita carbon dioxide emissions, a critical metric for assessing environmental impact and sustainability.

Sea_Level_Rise_mm: Measured sea level rise in millimeters, useful for understanding coastal and climate-related risks.

Rainfall_mm: Total annual rainfall in millimeters, which can be analyzed in relation to climate variability and water resource management.

Population: The total population of the country, providing context for per capita analyses.

Renewable_Energy_pct: The percentage of energy derived from renewable sources, highlighting progress towards sustainable energy transitions.

Extreme_Weather_Events: The number of recorded extreme weather events, enabling studies of climate variability and disaster management.

Forest_Area_pct: The percentage of land covered by forests, an important indicator of ecological health and carbon sequestration potential.

## How to read the dashboard :
There is a list on left from where you can select the metric you want to see. Below it there is a slider to select the year.

In this dashboard select the area in map and the metric you want to see, graph on the side will show how metric has changed over years for that country.

Move the slider to a particular year and in map you can see the metric for each country in that year.

Select the Metric and in map you will see average of that metric for each country over the years and in graph you will see the average of all countries for each year for that metric.
